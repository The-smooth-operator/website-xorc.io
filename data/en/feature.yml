    title : Based on 3 years of experience and development
    description : >
      The Open Source Xray Platform builds on a wealth of experience and insight gathered while developing and maintaining the first incarnation of the software as the basis for a successful commercial marketing suite. The completely rewritten core expands on this foundation to provide a platform generic enough to tackle this use case and much, much more.

    title : First commercial use of the Orc Language
    description : >
      The Orc language reimagines the problem of orchestrating complex, concurrent workflows as a process calculus. This mathematical basis allows you to elegantly and concisely express the complete lifecycle of business processes while our compiler sees to it that the code running on production is stable and bug free.
