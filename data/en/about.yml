    title : Use for the Internet of Things
    description : >
      Create rules-based systems based on sensors and data from any connected device using our Open Source core as stream processing engine. With the addition of a simple API you can power projects as small as your own private smart home or as big as an interconnected city of the future. The connector system allows for you to easily tap in to external AI and deep learning APIs and deliver decisions and results directly to your ORC programs, no matter where they run.
